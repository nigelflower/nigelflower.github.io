I am currently a fifth year graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at NYU, where I am currently studying with Dr. Liina Pylkkänen. I use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investgiate the complex series of computations that occur in the brain when presented multiple words at the same time.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the neural bases underlying logical expressions such as "all," "some," and "no" in addition to discourse related expressions such as "the" or "a." These kinds of words establish relations with contentful words in language. We can easily imagine what the word "cat" refers to, but what about a word like "every"?
